This is my first Github repository

  Hello, humans!
  My name is James Light. I'm now a postgraduate in UCAS and major in CS. I'm familiar with C and C++. But recently I get insterested in many other languages such as Python, CUDA, lua and so on. And I urge to try using different editors such as Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, Atom and so on. I increasingly realize that there are so much fun in the ocean of CS!
